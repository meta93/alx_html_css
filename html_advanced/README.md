In this and coming projects, I am implementing from scratch a webpage from a designer file.

This designer file will be available on Figma - feel free to create an account to access the final result here:

    Page in Figma
    fig file

And “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

    if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro(https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/8hNBFlYM0g_mGr6seXbVHA) and Spin-Cycle-OT(https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/ICDCkSOYlUm6OclNPeCdgg).

    some values are in float - feel free to round them.
